# Monitoring Stack Architecture

## Overview

This monitoring stack is built using the following key components:

1. **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage.
2. **Grafana**: Visualization of metrics and logs.
3. **Alertmanager**: Alerting based on metrics from Prometheus.
4. **Loki**: Log aggregation and querying.

## Component Details
### Prometheus
Prometheus is responsible for collecting and storing metrics. It uses a pull-based model to scrape metrics from configured targets, including the Node Exporter, which provides system-level metrics.

### Grafana
Grafana is used to visualize the data collected by Prometheus and logs aggregated by Loki. Pre-configured dashboards are provided for common metrics.

### Alertmanager
Alertmanager handles alerts generated by Prometheus based on predefined rules. It routes these alerts to various notification channels like email, Slack, or PagerDuty.

### Loki
Loki aggregates logs from different sources, which can then be queried and visualized within Grafana.

### Scalability
The architecture is designed to be scalable, with the ability to increase replicas, add new data sources, and integrate with additional alerting and logging systems.
